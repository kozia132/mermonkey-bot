# Setup
download the source code

install python 3.9 (any version of python 3 should work but i personally used 3.9)

open a command prompt as admin and navigate to the folder

run `pip install requirements.txt`

open the folder in vscode cause i couldnt get it to work correctly just running the script by itself

make sure your game is on the MAIN MENU and not anywhere else (main menu with the play and social buttons n stuff)

run the script through vscode

terminate the script by pressing ctrl+c in the vscode terminal or by just closing vscode that works too
